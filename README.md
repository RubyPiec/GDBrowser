  ## How do I run this?
If you're just here to use GDBrowser locally because the site is down or blocked or restricted or god knows what, this is the only part you really need to read


To run GDBrowser locally:
1) Install [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) if you don't already have it
2) Clone/download this repository  
3) Open cmd/powershell/terminal in the main folder (with index.js)
4) Type `npm i` to flood your hard drive with code that's 99% useless
5) Type `node index` to run the web server
6) GDBrowser is now running locally at http://localhost:2000


## Important

I stole this from Colon's GDBrowser, I just changed the GDPSes.
